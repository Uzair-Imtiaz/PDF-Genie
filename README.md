# PDF Genie
# AI Chatbot for PDF Analysis

## Overview

This project is an AI chatbot designed to interact with users and provide information related to a PDF document. The chatbot prompts the user to upload a PDF file, and once the file is provided, users can ask questions related to the content of the PDF. The chatbot leverages Kotlin and the LLMa-2 7-B model for natural language generation.

## Features

- **PDF Interaction:** Users can upload a PDF file for analysis.

- **Question-Answering:** The chatbot can answer questions related to the content of the uploaded PDF.

- **Natural Language Generation:** LLMa-2 7-B model is used for natural language generation, making the responses more coherent and context-aware.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Kotlin
- LLMa-2 7-B model (pre-trained for natural language generation)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Chatbot-PDF-Analysis.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed.

4. Run the project on an Android emulator or device.

## Usage

1. Launch the application on the emulator or device.

2. The chatbot will prompt you to upload a PDF file.

3. Select a PDF file from your device.

4. Once the PDF is uploaded, you can start asking questions related to the content of the PDF.

5. The chatbot will use the LLMa-2 7-B model to generate responses based on the input questions.

## Dependencies
